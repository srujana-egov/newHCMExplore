Functional Specifications – Detailed documentation of core modules, including campaign type setup, inventory management, beneficiary data handling, boundary hierarchies, system user roles, and more 2. Role Action Mapping – Defines the permissions and actions available to each system role—from system administrators to registrars, supervisors, warehouse managers, and programme managers—ensuring clarity, security, and accountability 3. Building Blocks & Services – Highlights the modular architecture of HCM, emphasising reusable, configurable building blocks—such as registries and service modules—that support adaptability, scalability, and seamless interoperability across campaigns and systems.",

This reduces maintenance, standardises configurations, and lowers infrastructure costs while allowing country-level customisation. Key new features include a **no-code Admin Console** for campaign setup, **server-generated beneficiary IDs** for registry reuse, **Enumeration and Transit tools** for flexible data collection, **QR-based attendance tracking**, and **peer-to-peer offline data sharing**. Enhancements include **multi-tenant and multi-schema database support**, **standardised Kafka topics**, **segregated mobile app endpoints**, and improved **Helm configurations**—all strengthening scalability, interoperability, and ease of management across countries.",
